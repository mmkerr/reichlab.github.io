We build open-source software motivated by our research projects with the  hope that you and others will find these tools useful. From D3 visualization platforms to SQL database utilities to R and python packages, we develop a diverse set of software that help us do better research. In addition to the projects listed above, lab members have also contributed to the development of [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the [ForecastFramework R package](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/ForecastFramework).
